                </p><br>
                <p>This wonderful site contains a list of method arrays with their definitions, along with what we've accurately named "The Hub." "The Hub" is a dynamic model that is interactive in ways that will help increase metacognitive thinking by providing simple studying techniques. <br><br> When interacting with one of the many nodes of The Hub, a flash card will appear upon click. The flashcard will present an array method, a problem, and an area for you, the user, to submit an answer. If your answer is <span class="red">incorrect</span>, the node will change to <span class="red">red</span>. If your answer is <span class="blue">correct</span>, the node will change to <span class="blue">blue</span>. The correct answer will display if you choose to go back to that array method, otherwise, you're also welcome to give the incorrect answers another try. The node will continue to show red until answered correctly. If you have solved all the questions you're wanting to do, you can click the reset button in the center which will populate another random 8 questions for you to continue trying. </p>
