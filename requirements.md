## Vision
Method(It) is a web app study tool designed to help a beginner programmer learn and understand how to implement array methods in Javascript. It helps improve their knowledge by presenting the user with flashcards with the initial side displaying information regarding a specific array method, and then the ability to flip the flashcard over to put that new information to use with a practice problem. 

## Scope (In)
- The web app will contain a study page with clickable nodes displayed.
- Method(It) will provide the user an opportunity to answer practice problems for different array methods
- The user will be able to go to the glossary page to refresh their memory and return to the study page without losing their progress

## Scope (Out)
- Method(It) will not have ecommerce features such as a shopping cart or checkout


## MVP
At a minimum, we need to be able to render a study page that displays nodes that the user can click on to view a flashcard and then the user needs to be able to input a response to the practice problem. Additionally, that response needs to be validated for accuracy and then inform the user of the result.

## Stretch Goals
- Add timer
- Add flip functionality instead of glossary page

## Functional Requirements 
- Study page renders with Method(It) hub and nodes
- On click, nodes will display a flashcard containing a practice problem and input field
- Input field can accept user's response and validate if the answer is right or wrong
- Tell the user if they got the answer right or wrong by changing the node color
