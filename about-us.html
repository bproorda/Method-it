        <h3 class="profile"><img class="person1" src="stacey1.jpg" /><br><p>Hello! My name is Stacey Teltser. After growing up in a suburb of D.C. I moved to Iowa to pursue my degree in psychology at Coe College. After graduating with my B.S., I worked for several years as a sign language interpreter. I started feeling stagnant in my career and, after learning about Delta V through work, found myself independently exploring online programming resources. I ultimately took the plunge and joined Delta V with the goal of working in a field that requires continuous problem solving and collaboration with others in the pursuit of creating and maintaining technology that impacts the lives of others.</p></h3>
        <h3 class="profile"><img class="person2" src="francesco1.jpg" /><br><p>My name is Francesco Troiano. I am a current student of the DeltaV code 201 course, and come from Waterloo, IA. I had worked in many customer service jobs prior to coming to Cedar Rapids to begin my coding career. I had moved into this field at the advice of a good friend and with knowledge of an ever growing market. I had heard some things about becoming a full stack developer and figured my ability to bring people together would fit perfectly into a world of people coming from all different backgrounds. I come from many jobs that have celebrated diversity and awareness, and helped lead some of those fronts and am excited to continue that development into the wonderful world of coding.</p></h3>
        <h3 class="profile"><img class="person3" src="brennan1.jpg" /><br><p>Hello!, I am Brennan Roorda, currently a software developer student at DeltaV code school in Cedar Rapids, IA. After working a variety of temporary jobs, that were menial and never challenged my brain, I decided that I need a long term career. I have been having a blast learning web development and excited to learn more. I excel at troubleshooting problems and breaking doing problem domains into the individual steps to solve them. I am looking forward to working as a software developer in a company where I can utilize my new skills and challenge myself to find more.</p></h3>
